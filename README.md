# Pierre's Sweet and Savory Treats

#### By _**Filmer Tolentino**_  

#### _This website allows Pierre to market his sweet and savory treats. The application has user authentication and a many to many relationship._  

### Features
* The application should have user authentication. A user should be able to log in and log out. Only logged in users should have create, update and delete functionality. All users should be able to have read functionality.
* There should be a many-to-many relationship between Treats and Flavors. A treat can have many flavors (such as sweet, savory, spicy, or creamy) and a flavor can have many treats. For instance, the "sweet" flavor could include chocolate croissants, cheesecake, and so on.
* A user should be able to navigate to a splash page that lists all treats and flavors. Users should be able to click on an individual treat or flavor to see all the treats/flavors that belong to it.
